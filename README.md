## Description

## User Story

AS A bootcamp student,

I WANT to discuss topics with everyone in the Web Development program

SO THAT I can expand my knowledge and resources.

GIVEN I am a bootcamp student,

WHEN I have a question I want to discuss

THEN I create a topic and post it in the student forum to share with every class.

## Testing

1. Verify that the page's look and feel matches the requirements provided for this assignment- (this may be slightly different depending on the view).
2. Check that an error message displays when no city or an incorrect city is entered.
3. There should be 2 containers that display showing the content matching the search (Concerts and Restaurants).   
4. Verify the pages that were supposed to display through the links are there.
