## Description

This application was built by four web developers at the UNC Charlotte Web Development Bootcamp. While taking the course, the developers thought that it would be more beneficial to have access to all students enrolled in the program. This forum allows for all students enrolled in the full-time and part-time course to have access to each other to discuss homework questions, resources, job information, and any other topics they wish to collaborate on.

## User Story

AS A bootcamp student,

I WANT to discuss topics with everyone in the Web Development program

SO THAT I can expand my knowledge and resources.

GIVEN I am a bootcamp student,

WHEN I have a question I want to discuss

THEN I create a topic and post it in the student forum to share with every class.

## How To Use
